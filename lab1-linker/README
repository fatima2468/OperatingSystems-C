Name of the source file is : linker_fm.cpp.
The file has been coded up in C++.
Supports compiler versions gcc-4.4.7 and gcc-6.2.0. 

Just to mention there is NO exception handling in the code for the case: if a filename that is not present as file is provided as input or if no argument is provided. The result will be ‘segmentation fault’. 

The code has been split up decently in to methods and tried using proper naming convention for procedures and variables to make it understandable.
